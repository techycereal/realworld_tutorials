# ðŸš€ Understanding JavaScript Promises with Real-World Examples

This project demonstrates how JavaScript Promises work using realistic scenarios such as:

- **Downloading files from multiple sources**
- **Sending emails**
- **Waiting for the fastest or all responses**

It explores methods like `Promise.race`, `Promise.all`, and `Promise.allSettled` to teach how async operations behave and how we can coordinate them effectively.

## ðŸ“¦ `Promise.race` â€” Fastest Response Wins

This example simulates downloading a file from **multiple servers**. We only care about the one that responds the fastest.

```js
function downloadFromServer(serverName, delay) {
    return new Promise(resolve => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            resolve(`Downloaded from ${serverName}`);
        }, delay);
    });
}

const server1 = downloadFromServer("Server A", 3000);
const server2 = downloadFromServer("Server B", 1500);
const server3 = downloadFromServer("Server C", 2000);

Promise.race([server1, server2, server3]).then((result) => {
    console.log(result);
});
```

**Explanation**:

- Each server responds at a different speed (using setTimeout).

- Promise.race() resolves as soon as the first promise finishesâ€”others are ignored.

- In this case, Server B wins because itâ€™s the fastest.

## ðŸ“¥ Downloading Files with Promise.all

This simulates downloading multiple files at the same time. You wait until all of them finish.

```js
function downloadFile(url) {
    return new Promise(resolve => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            resolve(`Downloaded file from ${url}`);
        }, 2000);
    });
}

const file1 = downloadFile('file1.zip');
const file2 = downloadFile('file2.zip');
const file3 = downloadFile('file3.zip');

Promise.all([file1, file2, file3]).then((results) => {
    console.log(results);
});
```

**Explanation**:

- Each download runs in parallel.

- Promise.all() waits until all downloads are complete.

- The result is an array of success messages.

- If any promise fails, Promise.all() will reject.

## ðŸ“§ Sending Emails with Promise.allSettled

This simulates sending emails, and we want to know which ones succeeded or failed.

```js
function sendEmail(to, message) {
    return new Promise(resolve => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            resolve(`Sent email to ${to} with the message ${message}`);
        }, 1500);
    });
}

const email1 = sendEmail("alex@example.com", "Hello Alex");
const email2 = sendEmail("jane@example.com", "Hi Jane");
const email3 = sendEmail("bob@example.com", "Hey Bob");

Promise.allSettled([email1, email2, email3]).then(results => {
    console.log(results);
});
```

**Explanation:**

- Each email sends independently.

- Promise.allSettled() waits for all of them to finish, regardless of success or failure.

- Each result tells you if the email succeeded or failed.

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts
- **Promise:** A container for a value that will be available in the future.

- **resolve:** Used to mark a Promise as "fulfilled" and provide the result.

- **.then():** Method used to define what to do when the Promise is resolved.

- **Non-blocking:** JavaScript doesnâ€™t wait for async tasksâ€”it moves on and comes back when theyâ€™re ready.

- **Promise.race():** Resolves or rejects as soon as one of the Promises in the array does.

- **Promise.all():** Resolves only when all Promises resolve; rejects if any fail.

- **Promise.allSettled():** Resolves when all Promises settle (regardless of success/failure).

## ðŸš€ Try It Yourself ##
To run the code:

1. Save the full script in a file called promisesFunctions.js.

2. Make sure you have Node.js installed.

3. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
node promisesFunctions.js
```
Youâ€™ll see:

- Which server responds the fastest.

- All download results after 2 seconds.

- Email results after 1.5 seconds.

And youâ€™ll also observe how async code doesnâ€™t block the flow of the program.
