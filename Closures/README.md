# 🔒 Understanding Closures in JavaScript and React

Closures are one of the most powerful—and sometimes tricky—concepts in JavaScript. This project demonstrates **how closures work** using:

- A **shopping cart** example with private state
- A **React counter** showing how closures behave inside component logic

---

## 🛒 JavaScript Example: Shopping Cart with Closure

This example shows how to **preserve private state** using closures in a plain JavaScript function.

```js
function createCart() {
    let total = 0;

    return {
        addItem(price) {
            total += price;
            console.log(`Item added. Total: $${total}`);
        },
        getTotal() {
            console.log(`Current total: $${total}`);
        }
    };
}

const cart = createCart();
cart.addItem(10);  // Item added. Total: $10
cart.addItem(5);   // Item added. Total: $15
cart.getTotal();   // Current total: $15
```

✅ **What’s Happening:**

- The `total` variable is enclosed in the returned object from `createCart()`.
- The functions `addItem` and `getTotal` still have access to `total` even after `createCart` has finished running.
- This is possible because of **closures**, which "remember" the surrounding variables even when the outer function is no longer executing.

⚛️ **React Example: Understanding Closures in Components**

React uses closures under the hood too. Here's a functional component showing how closures can affect behavior in a UI setting.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const increment = () => {
    setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1);
    console.log(`Current count: ${count}`);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```

🧠 **Why It Matters:**

- `increment` is a closure — it captures the current value of `count` when the component renders.
- Inside the `setCount` call, we use a functional update (`prevCount => prevCount + 1`) to ensure we work with the latest state.
- However, the `console.log(count)` will often show stale data, because it logs the captured value of `count` when the closure was created.

---

🧠 **Key Concepts**

- **Closure:** A function that "remembers" variables from the scope in which it was created, even after that scope has finished.
- **Private State:** You can simulate private variables in JavaScript using closures (e.g., `total` in `createCart()`).
- **React Closures:** Functions defined inside React components can "trap" old values from earlier renders. Use `setState(prev => …)` to avoid bugs.

🚀 **Try It Yourself**

### JavaScript (Cart Example)

1. Save the cart code in a file named `cart.js`.
2. Run it using Node.js:

```bash
node cart.js
```
